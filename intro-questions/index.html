My name is Caroline Fesler. I am a junior Communication Design and Education major. I am taking this class because it is required for my major. I'm not great with computers so I'm hoping to improve my confidence working digitally in this class. <p>
I am from St. Louis and I traditionally like to draw and illustrate. <p>
I have no experience iwth CSS/HTML/JS. <p>
I hope to be able to design a pretty portfolio site. <p>
I expect designing for the screen to be different than designing for the page because there's less boundaries and clear borders. <p>
https://www.nationalgeographic.com I think that the National Geographic website has effective design because it is nice to look at with simple, clean lines and a coordinating color scheme. It lets the photos do the talking and shows them off well. <p>
https://www.nationalgeographic.com I think that the Lululemon website demonstrates effective communication because it directs you to the different styles in a way that is simple and easy to find what you are looking for.
